## Message API

CRUD API that manages message and provides details about those messages, specifically if the messageis a palindrome or not.

Following operations are supported:

- Create / Read / Update / Delete : Message
- List all Messages

### API Docs

---

API docs get generated by swagger. Will be accessible at `{serverAddress}/docs`. For instance if you are running this service locally at port 3000, docs will be available at `localhost:3000/docs`

- GET /messages
- GET /messages/:id
- PATCH /messages/:id
- POST /messages
- DELETE /messages/:id

### Architecture

---

Any requests coming in will go via the router to controller. Controllers have their own logic and DB operations are executed in associated entity service which operates on DB operations on the entity model.

### Testing

---

Included API tests (mocha, supertest)
